<h1>Password Rules Chrome Extension</h1>
<p>
  This is the chrome extension for the Password Rules website. This extension provides a subset of the functionality 
  that is available on the site. The extension checks the url of the user's current tab and pulls up the password rules entry
  for the site. If no entry is found, a link is provided for the user to add the site themselves if they wish to do so.
